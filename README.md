My attempt at modifying [Floop's script](https://github.com/floop-s/floops-reaper-scripts/releases/tag/floop-sheet-reader-v2.1.0) in order to have it working under Linux

All thanks and congrats to Floops the author!!

# Floop’s REAPER Scripts

This repository contains a collection of **JSFX effects** and **Lua scripts** for
**REAPER**, focused on audio processing, monitoring, and workflow enhancement.

All tools are released as **free and open-source software**.

---

## Repository Structure

The tools are organized into the following directories:
- `scripts/`: Lua scripts
- `effects/`: JSFX effects

Each tool is contained in its own folder and typically includes:
- the script or effect file (`.lua` or `.jsfx`)
- a dedicated `README.md` with usage instructions and details

This structure allows the repository to be used both:
- via **ReaPack**
- and by manually downloading individual tools from GitHub
